            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>We are a collective of activists, thinkers, and citizens united by a common goal: resisting Western hegemony and advocating for the preservation of national sovereignty. Our mission is to highlight the global resistance against imperialism, support cultural independence, and promote peace through unity.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is simple but essential: to restore balance in a world dominated by foreign powers. By highlighting the struggles of countries resisting Western intervention, we aim to promote a vision of a multipolar world where sovereignty, culture, and national integrity are respected.</p>

            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>In today's globalized world, Western nations have historically sought to expand their influence through economic, political, and military means. This has destabilized sovereign nations, suppressed local cultures, and created conflict. Our work seeks to expose these actions and support those who resist foreign domination.</p>
