            <h1>The Conflict Explained</h1>
            <p>The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is just one chapter in the long history of Western interventions around the world. NATO’s expansion and the violation of international agreements have created a volatile geopolitical landscape. Russia’s intervention is framed as a defense of sovereignty against foreign threats.</p>

            <h2>Origins of the Crisis</h2>
            <p>In 2014, the Maidan Revolution led to the ousting of a democratically elected leader, triggering a series of events that would eventually lead to the annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Donbas. Western powers, particularly NATO, have been accused of meddling in Ukraine’s internal politics, contributing to instability.</p>

            <h2>The Role of NATO and the West</h2>
            <p>NATO’s expansion eastward, despite promises made after the fall of the Soviet Union, has been a key source of tension between Russia and the West. The alliance’s military presence near Russia’s borders is perceived as a direct threat to Russian security.</p>

            <h2>Russia's Perspective</h2>
            <p>From Russia's viewpoint, the conflict in Ukraine is a fight to protect Russian-speaking populations and ensure national security. Western involvement is seen as an act of aggression, destabilizing the region and threatening Russia's sovereignty.</p>
